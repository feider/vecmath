# Vecmath lib

A small vector math library I wrote to understand how they work.
Maybe at some point I will add OpenMP or OpenCL or CUDA support or something similar to support parallel computing of stuff

## Usage

Include the `vecmath.h` header file and compile the `vecmath.c`, look at the makefile for examples. You also need to link to your math library with -lm.
